the first statement basically gets karel to see if he can pick thing.
if he can, he will turn right, if karel cannot pick thing, then he will turn left

the second statement gets karel to see if something is in front of him.
since it has the negative (!) on it, if he cannot pick thing, he will turn left.
And if karel can pick thing, he will turn right.

so although the code looks different the outcome is the same for both statements.
